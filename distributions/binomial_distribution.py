Binomial distribution is a probability distribution that summarises the likelihood that a 
variable will take one of two independent values under a given set of parameters. 
The distribution is obtained by performing a number of Bernoulli trials.

A Bernoulli trial is assumed to meet each of these criteria :

    - There must be only 2 possible outcomes.

    - Each outcome has a fixed probability of occurring. A success has the probability of p,
        and a failure has the probability of 1 â€“ p.

    - Each trial is completely independent of all others.
